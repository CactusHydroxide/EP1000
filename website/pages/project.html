            <h2 id='Intro'>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This page is dedicated to documenting my final project of EP1000. I would be going through the ideation
                and design process of how I build my project. This is a step by step guide on how to make this project.
                Feel free to follow along to also build your own light clock. Downloads for the files will be included
                bellow.

            <p>Here are some sketches used to help visualise the concept of the project</p>

            <p>In this section, we will be going through all the circuitry and code used to make the project run.</p>
            <h3 id="Wires">Circuit</h3>
            <p>Here is the circuit diagram of my project. Take note of what pins the individual components are connected
                to. The 7 Segment Display (TM1637) is connected to pins 2, 3, +5v and ground. The NeoPixel Strip is
                connected to 4 and ground. The Push buttons are connected to 5, 6 and 7 respectively. Lastly, the DC
                power is connected to the VIN pin.</p>

                src="../images/Picture/anime-lumine-genshin-impact-beach-sweetheart-school-uniform-wet-clothing-hd-wallpaper-preview.jpg"
                alt="">

            <p>Before working with my Arduino Nano, I used a Arduino Uno to test the code and circuit. This is because
                the Uno has pre soldered female headers, making it easy to quickly test my circuit with ribbon cables.
                This prevent me from needing to solder anything before I was confident that my circuit would work.</p>

                alt="" id="stepimg">


            <h3 id="Code">Code</h3>
            <p>The code for the project was written in Arduino IDE. I used 3 libraries in the embeded program. The first
                is Adafruit Neopixel. This library allows me to control the Neopixel LED strip and have them display
                different designs and pattern. The second library is TM1637Display. It allows me to quickly and easily
                display txet on Tm1637 7Segment display. The last library is the Arduino library. Without it you would
                not be able to properly program and Arduino circuit.</p>
            <hr />

            <h2 id="Model">Modelling</h2>
            <p>Using fusion 360, I modelled the clock. There is 3 main components to the clock. First it is the front
                face. It will be the design of the display. The second is the body. It is used to house the components.
                Lastly, it is the back. The back will contain multiple buttons and components to facilitate the
                operation of the clock. On top of the main components, there is also a stand. The stand keeps the clock
                at a optimal viewing angle when placed on a table.</p>
            <i>Insert 3 img for front back and body</i>
            <i>Insert 3D model</i>
            <hr />

            <h2 id="#Print">3D Printing</h2>
            <p>3D printing is very useful as it allowed me to create the body of the clock and its stand. It gives my a
                lot of flexibility when it comes to creating different shapes and sizes.</p>
            <p>I printed the body of the clock. It was sliced specifically for the school printer. The settings used are
                as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>0.3mm Layer Height</li>
                <li>60mm/s</li>
                <li>10% infill</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The image I took of the print was corrupted thus I cannot show it. However here is some pictures of the
                final product where you can see it. It is the purple layer in the center sandwiched between the acrylic
                layers.</p>

            <p>I printed hte stand of the clock out of school with the help of a friend. The printer used is a Ender 3
                v2. The setting used was:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>0.2mm Layer Height</li>
                <li>80mm/s</li>
                <li>10% infill</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here is some images of the stand.</p>

            <h2 id="#Cut">Laser Cutting</h2>
            <p>For my project, I used the laser cutter to cut out the face and back of the clock. Since the laser
                cutting machine is very precise, it is very useful to create holes the right size for buttons and other
                electronic components. It is also very fast, making it ideal to quickly cut faces.</p>
