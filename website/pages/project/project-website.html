            <h2 id='Intro'>Why make a website?</h2>
            <p>Developing this website serves multiple purpose. Firstly, it can help me develop my skills as a web
                designer. Allowing me to practice my HTML and CSS/SASS skills. Secondly, it allows me to easily view
                my
                projects at any time. If I would like to share my projects with others, I can navigate to this site
                to
                show others what I have done. Lastly, this website serves as a learning resource for others who
                would
                like to embark on their own journey into digital fabrication and rapid prototyping.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 id='Why'>Why did you create a website from scratch?</h2>
            <p>Creating my website from scratch gives me a lot of advantages in comparison to using a website
                builder
                like wix. Firstly, creating my own website gives me the flexibility to create whatever I want. If I
                am
                able to learn something I can code it into the webpage. However, a website builder only lets me use
                their pre-existing templates and components that severely limit what I can do.</p>
            <p>
                Creating a website is also a good opportunity to familiarise myself with how webpages are built.
                I have gained a better understanding on how the webpages I use on a daily basis work. This website
                allows me
                to appreciate all the hard work that has gone into the websites I view on a daily.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 id='HTML'> Basic HTML </h2>
            <p>This is my original website I made with basic HTML. It uses elements such as headers, list,
                paragraphs
                and much more.</p>

            <h2 id='Styling'> Basic Styling </h2>
            <p>There are 2 main ways of styling a HTML page. The first method is known as <i>inline styling</i>.
                Inline
                styling is written inside the HTML file. The second method is using a Cascading Style Sheet, also
                known
                as CSS. CSS is another type of file used to style HTML elements.</p>
            <p>This video can help you learn about CSS: <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE&feature=youtu.be">Learn CSS in 12 minutes</a>
            </p>
            <div class=' w-75 mx-auto' style="height: 352px;""><iframe src=" /EP1000/website/other/indexcss.html"
                style='width: 100%;' height="350" class="border border-secondary"></iframe>
                <p><i>This preview of the website is interactive, feel free to scroll and click it.</i></p>
            </div><br><br>
            <p>I used CSS to style this webpage. I did so as CSS helps me better organise my website files. By
                separating the files, I am able to better see the code that I am writing. Using CSS also gives me
                more
                flexibility to change up the styles if I do not like it. I can link a different CSS file if I find
                the
                original one too bland any time I wish without changing anything in the HTML file.</p>

            <h2 id='Styling2'> Advance Styling </h2>
            <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>There are 2 main types of addition styling I used for this webpage. First I used the <a
                    href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/'>bootstrap</a> framework.
                Bootstrap is a popular framework used to built webpages. It helps me reduce the time it takes to
                develop
                and style
                this website with its many classes. By adding classes to my webpage, I am able to quickly create my
                navbar, tables and style my page with quick yet simple styling. </p>
            <h3>SCSS</h3>
            <p>The second addition styling feature I have in this webpage is Sassy CSS, also known as SCSS. SCSS is
                similar to CSS, however it is much more powerful. I am able to set variables to help me quickly
                colour
                my page. It also lets me nest different styles and classes to reduce the messy code that CSS can
                generate. SCSS can also interact with Bootstrap by overwriting some of its defaults, allowing me to
                add
                my own colour scheme into the webpage. You can read more about SCSS <a
                    href="https://sass-lang.com/">here</a>.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id='Git'>Github</h2>
            <h3>What is Github?</h3>
            <p>Github is a development platform that allows collaborative coding. You can also use it to store
                projects
                in the cloud. In github, you can create repository also known as repos. They are where you store
                your
                projects. Each repo comes with a default master branch. You can make a copy of the master branch to
                make
                edits to your project without disrupting the master. When you upload your changes, it is known as a
                commit. Each commit consist of a title, a quick description, and the changes to the project. Lastly,
                when you download the latest copy of a project, it is known as a pull request. You can read more
                about
                github <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_github.asp'>here</a>.</p>
            <p>For this project, I will be using Github to document my work and to host this website. Next I explain
                how to host in github.</p>

            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>It goes without saying but you would need to register a github account. <a
                    href='https://github.com/signup'>https://github.com/signup</a> to create an account. If you
                already have an account you can login and move on to the next step. </p>
            <img src="../../images/website/one.png" alt="Github signup" class="stepimg">

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Once you have logged in, create a new repository by clicking the 'new' button on the left. Afterwards
                fill in the details for your repo. Add a README file to write what your project is about and choose
                the MIT license. </p>
            <img src="../../images/website/two.jpg" alt="" class="stepimg">
            <img src="../../images/website/three.png" alt="" class="stepimg">

            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Install Github desktop. Github desktop allows you to use github without memorising all the Git codes.
                You can install github desktop from <a href='https://desktop.github.com/'>here</a>.</p>
            <img src="../../images/website/four.png" alt="" class="stepimg">

            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>After logging into github desktop, clone the repository to your device. Remember to take not of where
                you cloned your repo!</p>
            <img src="../../images/website/five.png" alt="" class="stepimg">

            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>The folder you cloned your repo to is now your workspace. You can start developing your website in
                the folder. Once you save your code, you have to commit your changes are push them the server. Add
                your summary and description at the bottom left of the application. Once you have committed your
                changes, push the changes to git!</p>
            <img src="../../images/website/six.png" alt="" class="stepimg">
            <img src="../../images/website/seven.png" alt="" class="stepimg">

            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Lastly, it is time to host your website. Go to your github repo > settings > pages. Set your details
                like mine and publish your website. Take note that you can only host 1 website on github at one
                time. </p>
