            <h2 id='Intro'><u>Why make a website?</u></h2>
            <p>Developing this website serves multiple purpose. Firstly, it can help me develop my skills as a web
                designer. Allowing me to practice my HTML and CSS/SASS skills. Secondly, it allows me to easily view my
                projects at any time. If I would like to share my projects with others, I can navigate to this site to
                show others what I have done. Lastly, this website serves as a learning resource for others who would
                like to embark on their own journey into digital fabrication and rapid prototyping.</p>

            <h2 id='Why'><u>Why did you create a website from scratch?</u></h2>
            <p>Creating my website from scratch gives me a lot of advantages in comparison to using a website builder
                like wix. Firstly, creating my own website gives me the flexibility to create whatever I want. If I am
                able to learn something I can code it into the webpage. However, a website builder only lets me use
                their pre-existing templates and components that severely limit what I can do.</p>
            <p>
                Creating a website is also a good opportunity to familiarise myself with how webpages are built.
                I have gained a better understanding on how the webpages I use on a daily basis work. This website
                allows me
                to appreciate all the hard work that has gone into the websites I view on a daily.</p>

            <h2 id='HTML'><u>Basic HTML</u></h2>
            <p>This is my original website I made with basic HTML. It uses elements such as headers, list, paragraphs
                and much more.</p>

            <h2 id='Styling'><u>Basic Styling</u></h2>
            <p>There are 2 main ways of styling a HTML page. The first method is known as <i>inline styling</i>. Inline
                styling is written inside the HTML file. The second method is using a Cascading Style Sheet, also known
                as CSS. CSS is another type of file used to style HTML elements.</p>
            <p>This video can help you learn about CSS: <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE&feature=youtu.be">Learn CSS in 12 minutes</a></p>
            <div class=' w-75 mx-auto' style="height: 352px;""><iframe src=" /EP1000/website/media/indexcss.html"
                style='width: 100%;' height="350" class="border border-secondary"></iframe>
                <p><i>This preview of the website is interactive, feel free to scroll and click it.</i></p>
            </div><br><br>
            <p>I used CSS to style this webpage. I did so as CSS helps me better organise my website files. By
                separating the files, I am able to better see the code that I am writing. Using CSS also gives me more
                flexibility to change up the styles if I do not like it. I can link a different CSS file if I find the
                original one too bland any time I wish without changing anything in the HTML file.</p>

            <h2 id='Styling2'><u>Advance Styling</u></h2>
            <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>There are 2 main types of addition styling I used for this webpage. First I used the <a
                    href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/'>bootstrap</a> framework.
                Bootstrap is a popular framework used to built webpages. It helps me reduce the time it takes to develop
                and style
                this website with its many classes. By adding classes to my webpage, I am able to quickly create my
                navbar, tables and style my page with quick yet simple styling. </p>
            <h3>SCSS</h3>
            <p>The second addition styling feature I have in this webpage is Sassy CSS, also known as SCSS. SCSS is
                similar to CSS, however it is much more powerful. I am able to set variables to help me quickly colour
                my page. It also lets me nest different styles and classes to reduce the messy code that CSS can
                generate. SCSS can also interact with Bootstrap by overwriting some of its defaults, allowing me to add
                my own colour scheme into the webpage. You can read more about SCSS <a
                    href="https://sass-lang.com/">here</a>.</p>
