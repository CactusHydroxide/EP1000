            <h2 id='Intro'> What is Computer Graphics </h2>
            <p>Computer graphics (CG) is images and graphics generated using the aid of a computer. CG has many uses
                such as poster, logos, drawing and games. There are 2 main types of CG that is used. The first being
                raster and the second being vector. Both types of graphics have their own usages and require different
                software to produce. </p>
            <hr>

            <h2 id='vs'> Raster vs Vector </h2>
            <p>Does raster and vector graphics really matter? What are their pros and cons? Images are images, why do
                you think so much? These are some questions that you might have right now. In this section, I would
                introduce what raster and vector images are, what are their similarities and what are their differences.
            </p>
            <p>The main difference between raster and vector images is in how they store the data of the image. In a
                raster image, each individual pixel of an image is saved. Vector images on the other hand uses equations
                to store the data of the images. What makes them so different you might ask? Since raster images save
                the pixel, the amount of data in the file is fixed. If you zoom in too much or change the file
                resolution, you would end up seeing the individual pixels of the image. On the other hand, since the
                data of vector graphics are stored in equations, they can be zoomed in as much as you want without
                losing any pixelation.</p>
            <p>Does that mean that vector is superior to raster? No. Although vector images can be scaled infinitely,
                they are harder to manipulate and are not easily readable but all devices. Raster images are better at
                capturing data, for example through a camera or a screenshot, while vector images are better when
                creating digital works that has to be upscaled and downscaled on the regular.</p>

            <h2 id='Raster'> Raster Graphics </h2>
            <p>For raster graphics, I will be using photoshop to edit the images. For this image, I will be removing the
                background and replacing it with another image.</p>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Load your image into the photoshop or your preferred raster image editing software. </p>
