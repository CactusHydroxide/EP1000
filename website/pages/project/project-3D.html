            <h2 id='Intro'>What is 3D modelling?</h2>
            <p>3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing that constructs a 3D object from a CAD model. It is
                commonly used for rapid prototyping and creating small objects. It usually refers to the action of
                depositing a material layer by layer until you have a finished product.</p>

            <h2 id='Intro2'>What is 3D printing?</h2>
            <p>3D modelling is the process of using vertices, edges and surfaces to create a 3D model. It requires the
                use of specialised applications to be done. 3D modelling has many purposes. Models can be used in art,
                animation, games and event printed. We will be 3D modelling with the intent to print our models. </p>
            <hr>

            <h2 id='How'>How to create a 3D model?</h2>
            <p>To learn how to 3D model, we will be making a chess knight piece. This knight piece will be 3D printed
                later. </p>
            <h2 id="part1">Part 1 - Setup</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>To start your model, we would need to define the size of our model. Press L (Shortcut to start a new
                sketch) and select plane. </p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/One.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Create rectangle with 2-point rectangle.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Two.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Use midpoint tool to select the bottom of the rectangle, and click the origin point to centre rectangle.
                This helps to center the rectangle to the origin.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Three.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Use sketch dimension to define the height and width of the rectangle. H:50 W:30. This helps to create a
                reference for how large our model will be. When you are done it should look something like this.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Four.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Look for a reference image. Using a reference image will make the process of modelling significantly
                easier. If you are unable to find a reference image online, you can always draw it out on paper or using
                any illustrative tool. Once you have a reference image, we will insert it into our canvas. To do so, go
                to . Insert > Canvas > Insert from my computer, and search for your image. To insert canvas, click the
                previously created rectangle. Flip and scale the reference image accordingly. </p>

            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Six.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Press the finish sketch button on top and hide rectangle. The rectangle is only used to scale the horse.
                Finally, hide the sketch of the rectangle using the tree on the right.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Seven.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h2 id="part2">Part 2 - Base</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Create a new sketch and select a new plane to model the horse.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Eight.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Under the create tab, use the line, arc and spline tool to out line half of the knights base. Draw out
                half of the knight's base.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Nine.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Select the base sketch. Press revolves. In the menu, select axis set the point of rotation to the y-axis.
                Next, set the type to full. Lastly ensure that the operation creates a new body. Once you are done click
                OK. Your base of the chest piece is complete.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Ten.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h2 id="part3">Part 3 - Horse</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Create new sketch and draw out the horse. It follows the same steps as sketching out the base. Take your
                time as you go along the curves of the knight piece to get all the details. Leave the mane out as we
                will be doing it separately.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Eleven.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Once you have finished the outline of the horse, select the extrude function. Follow the settings as
                shown bellow. Take note of which measurement you choose. If you pick the first one, your distance refers
                to the distance between the center and the side. If you choose the second one, the distance is the
                thickness of the entire structure. Lastly, remember to set the operation to join as this top piece is
                going to attach to the base.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Twelve.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Next, create a new sketch on the surface of the ears. On that surface, draw out how you would like the
                ears to look. Lastly, use the extrude function to remove the excess. Remember to set the distance as a
                negative number and set the operation to cut.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Thirteen .png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Fourteen.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Fifteen.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Lastly remove the excess on the top of the horses ear/</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Sixteen .png" alt="" class='stepimg'>


            <h2 id="part4">Part 4 - Mane</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Create a new sketch of the mane of the horse. As previously done.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Seventeen.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Using the extrude function, do the same as before. Do remember to keep the distance thinner than the body
                of the horse, and set the operation back to join.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Eighteen.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>


            <h2 id="part5">Part 5 - Chamfer</h2>
            <h3> Step 1</h3>
            <p>Next we will chamfer the edges to make the horse look better. Select all the edge that you would like to
                chamfer.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Nineteen.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3> Step 2</h3>
            <p>Use the chamfer function. You can play with the incline of the edge to have it be to your liking.</p>
            <img src="../../images/3D Modeling/IMG/Twenty.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>

            <h3>Final Product</h3>
            <p>Viola! Your 3D model of a knight piece is done. This is how mine looks like</p>
