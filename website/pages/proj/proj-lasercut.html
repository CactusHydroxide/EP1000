            <h2 id="Intro">What is Laser Cutting?</h2>
            <p>Laser Cutting is the process of using a high power laser with pin point precision to cut sheets of
                material. It allows you to be able to cut sheets of material very precisely. It also allows you to be
                able to engrave images in material. This gives you a lot of flexibility on your design. </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id='Design'>Laser Cutting - Designing</h2>
            <p>The laser cutting machine requires a <a href="./project-cg.html#Vector">Vector image</a> file to know
                what it is going to cut. The colours of the graphic refer to different laser cutting settings. For this
                project we will be using 2 colours, red and black. Red will refer to cutting and black will refer to
                engraving.</p>
            <p>I will be using Adobe Illustrator to create my vector file. The design we will be making is that of a
                keychain with a QR code. Before we start, make sure you have a reference image ready for your QR code,
                or any design you would like to create.</p>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>First we have to set up our AI file. When creating a new file, ensure that you create it with the
                dimensions of 10 x 10 cm. Colour mode and raster effects will not affect the file so do not worry too
                much about them. However, most would prefer to set Colour Mode to RGB.</p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/One.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Next, insert your reference image into your file. Adjust the size of the reference image to 3.5cm x 3.5cm
                Once you have done so, center it on the page and lock
                it on the layer window. (Use F7 to bring up the layers window)</p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/Two.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Now, we need to convert this raster image to a vector graphic. However, due to the nature of the QR
                code, we do not need to convert it to a vector. If you are using another raster image, do look at <a
                    href='./project-cg.html#Vector'>Vector Graphic</a> to learn more.</p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Next we will be draw the outline of the keychain. Use the curve rectangle tool to draw a 4cm x 4cm
                square. You can left click while selecting the tool to choose the exact measurements of the rectangle.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/Three.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Once you have the outline, use the colour selection at the bottom to change the colour of the rectangle.
                Set the outline of the rectangle to red and remove the fill of the rectangle. Lastly, center the
                rectangle on the artboard.</p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/Four.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Now create 2 circles. They should have width and height of 1cm and 0.5cm respectively. Center the smaller
                circle inside the larger one and overlap them with the top of your keychain. It should look as follows.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/Five.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <p>We will now be merging all the shapes together. Select only the outer circle and the rectangle and use
                the unite tool to merge both shapes. You can see which shape mode I used on
                the top left. If you do not see the pathfinder tab, press Ctrl + Shift + F9 to open it.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/Six.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <p>Next, select the smaller circle and the outer shape. Then use the minus front tool to cut out the smaller
                circle from the main shape. Again, you can see the tool used on the top right
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/Seven.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3>Step 9</h3>
            <p>Lastly, select the newly merged shapes and set the thickness to 0.25px. This will ensure that the cut
                will be as thin as possible.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/Eight.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3>Step 10</h3>
            <p>To make the engraving nicer, we would want to engrave on the back of the acrylic sheet. Select
                everything, right click > transform > reflect vertically. This will flip the design and prepare it for
                cutting.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/Nine.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3>Step 11</h3>
            <p>Ensure that you save your file as a vector. Save it as a AI, SVG or PDF. Ensure that your laser cutting
                is able to take your vector file format as an input.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/Nine.png" alt="" class='stepimg'>
            <h3>Final Product</h3>
            <p>You have not created a design to be laser cut! Your design should look as shown below! You may also
                download the file below to cut for yourself!

            <h2 id='Cut'>Laser Cutting - Cutting</h2>
            <p>Now that you have prepared your vector file, we will be moving to the Laser Cutting machine. Ensure that
                you have a working thumb drive with the vector file on it. </p>

            <h3>My experience with the laser cutting machine.</h3>
            <p>I first opened my vector file on the computer connected to the laser cutting machine using the installed
                vector file editor. If you need to make last minute changes to your vector file you can do so here too.
                It allows you to make edits between cuts if your cuts do not turn out nice. When you are done with the
                graphic, press print and open the laser cutting software to cut your material.
            </p>
            <p>Once my file is loaded, I went to the settings menu and changed ny laser's power, speed and pulse per
                inch
                (PPI)
                according to the material. Consult your lab tech if you are unsure what levels you should be cutting
                your material at.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/cutting/cutsetting.jpg" alt="" class="stepimg">
            <p>If you look closely at this image, you would see that red, which is my cutting line, has the setting set
                wrongly. The speed is set to 60% instead of 6% and you would see the effects of it later. </p>
            <p>Lastly, I moved the laser head to a space with enough space to cut my keychain. I moved my design to
                laser head and stared cutting. </p>
            <p>If you use masking tape over your material, it prevents the material from burning due to the fumes from
                adjacent material being zapped. It keeps your acrylic clear. </p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/cutting/cutting1.jpg" alt="" class="stepimg">
            <p><i>Laser go brrrrr</i></p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/cutting/cutting2.jpg" alt="" class="stepimg">
            <p>As the speed of my laser was too high the first time, I ended up engraving the outline instead
                of cutting out the keychain. Afterwards, I adjusted the speed accordingly and it cut out my keychain.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/Laser Cutting/cutting/cutfinal.jpeg" alt="" class="stepimg">
            <p>This is the final product! I tried to paint the center but it did not look as nice as I thought it would.
                I am looking at different ways to fill the inside of the engraving.</p>

            <h2 id="3D">Laser Cutting - 3D Models</h2>
            <p>You can also create laser cutting files from 3D models. I will be cutting the box I made using parametric
                modelling. You can find more about it <a href='proj-3D.html#para'>here</a>. You can follow the same
                steps with any 3D model as long as it is mainly made of sheets of materials. </p>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Open your 3D model in Fusion 360. You may use other modelling software but the steps might be different.
                My model is of a box, and thus I will be cutting each side of the box using the laser cutter. Select the
                face of the model that you will like to cut and make a sketch of it.</p>
